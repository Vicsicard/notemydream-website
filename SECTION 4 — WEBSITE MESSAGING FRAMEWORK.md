# **SECTION 4 — WEBSITE MESSAGING FRAMEWORK**

*(The structure and messaging logic of your entire landing page.)*

This framework ensures that:

✔ Your homepage flows emotionally and logically  
 ✔ It communicates value before details  
 ✔ It reinforces your core positioning  
 ✔ It speaks in your approved brand voice  
 ✔ It stays mobile-app focused  
 ✔ It maximizes installs (primary goal)

---

# **4.1 — Website Purpose (Primary Role of Site)**

The website has ONE central job:

**Drive users to download the mobile app on iPhone or Android.**

Everything else is secondary.

Therefore, all messaging must:

* Reinforce the mobile-first nature of the product

* Keep page sections short, emotional, and clear

* Use consistent CTAs to “Get the iOS App” & “Get the Android App”

* Avoid deep feature explanations or long text

This site is NOT:

❌ a blog  
 ❌ a desktop-app platform  
 ❌ a heavy educational site  
 ❌ an all-in-one content ecosystem

It is a **high-conversion mobile app landing page**.

---

# **4.2 — Messaging Hierarchy (The Order of What You Communicate)**

Every effective app landing page follows this order:

### **1\. Identity — Who you are**

### **2\. Promise — What you help the user achieve**

### **3\. Function — How the app works**

### **4\. Differentiation — Why it’s unique**

### **5\. Proof — Why it matters / social proof**

### **6\. Action — Download the app**

Your site will follow this EXACT hierarchy to maximize conversion.

---
