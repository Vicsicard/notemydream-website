# **SECTION 2 — BRAND VOICE & MESSAGING SYSTEM (Deep-Dive Guide)**

*(This section defines how NoteMyDream “speaks” everywhere.)*

---

# **2.1 — Brand Voice Overview (The Core Personality)**

Your brand voice is:

### **“70% Soft & Healing • 30% Modern & Minimal”**

This hybrid identity creates a voice that feels:

✔ Gentle but clear  
 ✔ Warm but concise  
 ✔ Reflective but grounded  
 ✔ Human but modern  
 ✔ Supportive but never emotional-heavy  
 ✔ Calm but not “woo woo”

This is the **official voice** used in:

* Website copy

* App Store listings

* In-app UI \+ microcopy

* Ads

* Social captions

* Emails

* Press releases

* Onboarding and Dream Guide responses

Every piece of language must feel like it came from the same calm, human, trustworthy source.

---

# **2.2 — Tone Principles (How the Voice Behaves in Every Sentence)**

### **Principle 1 — Calm**

No intensity. No hype.  
 Language should feel like early morning light.

**Examples:**

* “Take a moment.”

* “Gently explore what surfaced.”

* “Let’s look at this together.”

---

### **Principle 2 — Clear**

No fluff. No rambling.  
 We favor short, clean sentences.

**Examples:**

* “Speak your dream.”

* “Your guide will listen.”

* “Save this reflection.”

---

### **Principle 3 — Supportive**

The voice is encouraging, never instructive.

**Examples:**

* “If it feels right, you can continue reflecting.”

* “What part of this stays with you?”

---

### **Principle 4 — Neutral**

We avoid judgment, analysis, labels, or interpretations.

**Examples:**

* “That sounds meaningful.”

* “There’s a lot happening in this dream.”

* “What emotion stands out the most?”

---

### **Principle 5 — Present-Focused**

Reflection is about *now*, not prophecy or prediction.

**Examples:**

* “How does this dream sit with you this morning?”

---

# **2.3 — Voice Attributes (What We *Are*)**

Your voice should always feel:

### **➤ Warm**

Like a soft conversation after waking up.

### **➤ Grounded**

Real-life, human, trustworthy.

### **➤ Minimal**

Never too many words.  
 Never too flowery.

### **➤ Curious**

We explore, we don’t diagnose.

### **➤ Gentle**

Soft prompts, never forceful direction.

### **➤ Respectful**

You speak *to* the user, not *at* them.

---

# **2.4 — Voice Anti-Attributes (What We *Are Not*)**

To maintain brand integrity, your voice should **never** feel:

### **🚫 Clinical or medical**

(We do not diagnose or treat)

### **🚫 Esoteric or mystical-heavy**

(No astrology, symbolism decoding, or spiritual authority)

### **🚫 “Self-help guru”**

(No big promises or life-changing claims)

### **🚫 Overly poetic**

(We’re soft, but not dramatic)

### **🚫 Robotic**

(Never generic AI-speak or emotionless responses)

### **🚫 Overly analytical**

(No dream interpretations, predictions, or meanings)

These guardrails protect legal safety AND maintain emotional trust.

---

# **2.5 — Writing Rules (The System That Governs All Copy)**

Everything we write must follow these rules:

---

### **Rule 1 — Use Simple Language**

Words should feel like everyday conversation.

**Use:**  
 “feel,” “notice,” “explore,” “look at,” “describe,” “hold,” “sense.”

**Avoid:**  
 “manifest,” “decode,” “symbolize,” “journey into,” “ascend,” etc.

---

### **Rule 2 — Questions \> Statements**

Prompts should open space, not close it.

**Good:**  
 “What part of this dream feels most alive?”

**Bad:**  
 “This dream clearly represents anxiety.”

---

### **Rule 3 — Invitations \> Instructions**

Let users choose their pace.

**Good:**  
 “If you’d like, you can add more details.”  
 “Whenever you’re ready…”

**Bad:**  
 “You need to…”  
 “You should now…”

---

### **Rule 4 — Emotional Neutrality**

No labeling emotions as good or bad.

**Good:**  
 “That sounds intense.”  
 “That seems meaningful.”

**Bad:**  
 “That’s scary.”  
 “That’s a negative dream.”

---

### **Rule 5 — Present Tense**

Keep the focus on *this morning*.

**Good:**  
 “How does this sit with you today?”  
 “What do you notice right now?”

**Bad:**  
 “This dream will affect you in the future.”  
 “This means your week will be difficult.”

---

# **2.6 — The Dream Guide Voice (In-App Personality)**

Your Dream Guide is the center of the brand.

It must feel:

✔ Soft  
 ✔ Present  
 ✔ Curious  
 ✔ Human  
 ✔ Warm  
 ✔ Approachable

### **Dream Guide should speak like:**

A calm friend  
 A gentle journaling companion  
 A supportive morning presence  
 A safe listener  
 A soft mirror

### **Dream Guide should not speak like:**

A coach  
 A therapist  
 A psychic
